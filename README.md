# Chain Reaction Game
Chain Reaction is a strategy game that involves two players. The goal of the game is to gain control of the board by eliminating the opponent's orbs.

The game is played by taking turns placing orbs in cells on the board. When a cell becomes overloaded with orbs, it explodes into the surrounding cells, adding an extra orb and claiming the cell for the player. Orbs can only be placed in a cell that is either blank or contains orbs of the same color as the player.

The game continues until one player loses all their orbs, at which point they are eliminated from the game. The last player standing wins the game.

The game is designed to be enjoyable for players, and the developer expresses their hope that players will have as much fun playing the game as they had coding it.

## Working
Chain Reaction utilizes a Graph Data Structure to power its gameplay mechanics. The graph is constructed using an adjacent list strategy, where each node stores an array of its neighboring nodes. The game also employs Breadth First Search algorithms to traverse the graph and determine whether the game is over or not.
